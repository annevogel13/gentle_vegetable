# Self assesment javascript 

Get the exercises files : 
* Option 1 : Download the javascript_ex folder. 
* Option 2 : Continue with the project from the html/css exercises. 
    * create a new folder
    * copy the index.html file into the new folder
    * create a script.js file 
    * change in the index.html the path to the css file 

*** 

## Exercise 1 

Link the javascript file to the index_js.html (forgotten how to do this, [click here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp#:~:text=down%20the%20display.-,External%20JavaScript,-Scripts%20can%20also))

Declare the following arrays : <br>
``  
const green_veggies = ["Spinach", "Kale", "Broccoli", "Cucumber", "Lettuce"] ``
<br>
``
const orange_veggies = ["Carrots", "Sweet Potatoes", "Peppers", "Pumpkins", "Tumeric"]
``<br>
``
const red_veggies = ["Tomato", "Beetroots", "Peppers", "Radish", "Rhubarb"]
``<br> 
`` 
const yellow_veggies = ["Corn", "Squash", "Eggfruit", "Advocado", "Zucchini"]
`` <br> 

Answer the following questions : 
* What does the **const** mean ? 
* Can we still change the elements inside the array? 

[And here is the answer to these questions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_const.asp#:~:text=Arrays%20are%20Not%20Constants)

Write functions that : 
* can add a vegetable to an array 
* remove a vegetable in the array 
    * if the boolean first is true then remove the first element 
    * else remove the last element 

**Need inspiration use [this](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp)**

**Hint: you can check if your functions are correct by using the console.log(name_function)**

You can open the console by clicking right in the browser and then select "open console".

## Exercise 2 

Now we want to be able to check if an veggie is already in the array before adding a new veggie. 

Create a function called : check_veggie_unique1 
* that uses a for-loop 
* uses a if-statement

Now create the same function but this time with a while-loop (called add_veggie_unique2)

**Check you answers with the script.js file given in the git-repo.**
