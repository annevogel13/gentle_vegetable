# Self assesement

## Level : Beginner

start with creating two files : 
* index.html
* style.css 

### Exercise 1 

Execute the following steps: 
* Initiate the index.html file with the standard html lines 
* Fill for the title "Gentle Vegetable" 
* Create a top-level header with 
    * line under and above the title 
    * a different color 
    * a different font 
    * aligned to the center 

    **Don't forget to link the style.css file to the index.html**

* Create two unorderd lists : 
    * green vegetables
    * orange vegetables 
    (for inspiration see the final website)
* Add a green background for the green vegetables (idem for the orange one) 

***

### Exercise 2 

To give our webpage more color, we want to add an image to the website. In the folder **images** you can find the images I used. Add the images to the html page. And use CSS styling to display to images with : 
* border of 3px
* black border
* width of border thick 
* add alt description 

***

### Exercise 3

Now to make navigation a bit easier on our webpage. We are going to add bookmarks (anchors) to our page. You can see this as the beginning of a navigation bar. 

Start by creating a unoderded list at the top of the page. And then do the following steps : 
* change the list style to none 
* change the block display 
* give a  border 
* add id-tags to the green and orange list 
* add to the li-tags in the navbar the a-tag

## Level : Intermediate 

### Exercise 1

Now we want to display to two list side by side. There are multiple ways to do this. Choose the way you feel the most comfortable with. 

hidden : 
* creation of 2 div's 
* changing inline-block properties 
* changing the width propertie 
* creating table (very difficult)

But now, the page looks kind of ugly. 
So now we want to centeralise the text inside the div.
This causes the list to look funny. So we want to remove the list symboles

### Exercice 2 

Ofcourse there a more colors vegetables and if we want to display them we will need flexboxes. 

First let create two more vegetable lists:
* red veggies
* yellow veggies 

Now lets create flexboxes 
* create one big div around all the veggie lists <-- this will be the flex container 
* give this div the id = "flexContainer" 
* give flexContainer the properties
    * display : flex; 
    * flex-direction: row;
    * flex-wrap : wrap; 
    * justify-content: space-around;
    for explanation about these terms visit [W3schools Container page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp)

    Play with these different properties to fully understand flexboxes.
