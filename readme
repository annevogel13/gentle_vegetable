Hi 


start with creating two files : 
* index.html
* style.css 

## Exercise 1 

Execute the following steps: 
* Initiate the index.html file with the standard html lines 
* Fill for the title "Gentle Vegetable" 
* Create a top-level header as the following picture  :
        {{ insert a picture }}
        !! don't forget to link the style.css file to the index.html !!
* Create two unorderd lists : 
    ** green vegetables
    ** orange vegetables 
    (for inspiration see the final website)

* Add a green background for the green vegetables (idem for the orange one)
